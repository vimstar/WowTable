The WowTable is a Vue.js wrapper for the Tabulator table that adds a lot of functionality such as Advanced Search UI, in table single row editing or multi-row, deleting, xlsx spreadsheet file importing, modal message dialogs, etc. The WowTable supports several ways to load table data and setup columns which are all configurable via the table options.

The sample Vue CLI project contains samples of how to do in-table cascading drop down selections, dynamic column generation with embeded functions, and much more.
